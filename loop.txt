types of loops:
1. forever loop:
   while(true): is a forever loop
2. while(boolean-expression):
   if the boolean-expression is true, all lines of code will be executed in order
   from top to bottom, until the boolean-expression becomes false
3. do while loop:
   executes all lines of code between the curly braces once, and then if the boolean-expression
   evaluates to true, will go back and repeat the process until boolean-expression is false
4. for loop:
   use it if you want to repeat it a number of times.
   for(start;expressiont; increment)
use cases:
while loop: use when you want a loop to repeatÂ and unkown number of of times, possibly not at all.
do-while loop: loop to repeat an unkown number of times, but at least once.
for loop: repeat the loop a discrete number of times, but don't know the number of times at the moment
the program is compiled.
